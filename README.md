# Movie review text classification using Naive Bayes and Linear SVC

#### For this project,I used the Cornell University Movie Review polarity dataset v2.0 obtained from http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/
#### The objective is to train a simple classification model that predicts positive and negative labels for movie reviews
#### I did this in a stepwise process consisting data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis on bag of words.
#### I continued by creating my ML model- vectorization and comparing performances of both Naive Bayes and SVC models. I then created a pipeline for the deployment of the better model on new reviews.
